# Front End Interview — Design System

## Hi and welcome to our code challenge. 👋

Make sure to carefully read the following brief, containing all the details you need.

## The Goal

For this take-home test, the goal is to develop a Tabs component that will be part of our Design System project.
The component should be accessible and reusable, following best practices in front-end development.

## Acceptance Criteria

Share with us the 🔗 link to your repository (don’t fork please) that contains everything you need to show us about the component and its features.
More exactly, we write some user stories:

- As a developer using the Tabs, I want to be able to switch between different variants of the tabs, according to the design.
- As a developer using the Tabs, I want some Tab to show additional information with a Badge, and I want to choose also an appropriate Badge variant.
- As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll through the Tab list if it’s wider than my screen, so I can access all Tabs.

There isn’t a specific way you should present your project, so feel free to structure it however you prefer.

You have 📅 7 days to complete the challenge.

## Instructions

- Design System Context: Build your component with reusability in mind, as it will be part of a larger Design System.
- Accessibility: Ensure your component is accessible and follows best practices.
- Restrictions:
  - Please don't use Tailwind or other CSS frameworks.
  - Use the CSS preprocessor you prefer. Alternatively, you can use CSS-in-JS or plain CSS, the important thing is writing CSS from scratch.
- React: The React part should be a raw implementation.
- Storybook: If you're familiar with it, feel free to use Storybook to showcase your component.

## Recap

- ⭐️ Goal: Create a Tabs component, with a fully implementation of HTML and CSS and a raw implementation of the React component for the Tab functionality.
- 📅 Time: 7 days
- 🎁 Delivery: GitHub repository link

We're looking forward to seeing your solution! This will give us a great starting point for our pair programming session, where we can dive deeper into your approach and coding style.
